Hello everyone, The files listed in this attachment are what I had to do to the .json files to enable the default traders to gain access to the mod that @4KBOSSK created with their vehicle addon package for Dayz. 


***NOTE***
This file edit includes all of the Dayz Expansion vehicles that come with the Bundle. If you have any additional vehicle mods, this will remove the vehicles to be purchasable at the trader. If this is the case, ensure that you add the vehicles to the file I provided. If they are not working after the edit, ensure that you have formatted the .json file appropriately. You can validate your .json edit here (https://jsonlint.com) If you are using this mod on a server that is not running the DayZ Expansion Bundle mod, then this .json may not work for you. 

Getting started, If you haven't already, subscribe to 4KBOSSK's workshop via the link below.

Install the mod on your server by pasting the downloaded workshop file into your root directory of your server location, and copy the key that is included with the download, into the keys folder located on your DayZ server. (don't forget to add the mod name to your bat file that you use for starting your server. 

Onto the .json files. It can be tricky, so I made these files to help those who had the same issue as myself. 

1.)  Ensure that you have created a back-up file in-case anything has changed since the time of this post.
  
  2.) Go to the .json file locations. Locations are typically under the following directory, (Your drive) DayZServer/config/ExpansionMod/Market. This directory is where you will be copying and paste the attached files. 

2.) Drag and drop Cars.json into the directory, If you have already obtained a backup of your default .json file, then it is     safe to overwright the file. 
3.) Repeat step 2 for the other file titled, Vehicle_parts.json

That's it, really. This is a good opportunity to edit any vehicle prices since you are here anyway. I have edited prices for my server for the default DayZ vehicles, but I have not edited any of the authors prices as of yet. But if that's what you want to do, the prices are located with the Cars.json file. 

Enjoy and I hope it works out for you!
